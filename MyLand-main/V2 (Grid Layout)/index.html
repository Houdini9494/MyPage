                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Giacomo and I've always loved computers and IT in general.<br>My interests began when I was five years old, when I used my grandfather's computer for the first time; the operating system was Windows 95, which I later upgraded to Windows 98 SE.<br>This early experience sparked a curiosity in me that led me to find out everything I could about hardware and how computers work.<br>
                    At the age of 15, I received my first desktop computer, which marked the beginning of my journey into experimenting and learning.<br>I taught myself to assemble, modify, and repair computers and notebooks, building solid technical skills that I’ve continued to develop and refine.<br>Over time, my passion expanded beyond hardware.<br>
                    During the 2020 lockdown, while staying at home like so many others, I seized the opportunity to dive into programming.<br>I began studying HTML and CSS to create web pages, and this initial step opened up a whole new world for me.<br>In 2021, I decided to pursue a professional path in software development and soon resumed my academic studies to further enhance my knowledge.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Since the end of 2022, I’ve been working towards my degree in Computer Science, focusing on improving my skills in languages like Python, C/C++, SQL, and more.<br>I’ve also developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, and I’m eager to make it my area of specialization.<br>
                    Currently, In addition to my studies, I'm also balancing a couple of jobs to support myself financially; I work as an assistant baker and also manage online sales for a bookstore.<br>It’s definitely a challenge to balance work and school, but I’m fully committed and determined to make it all work.<br>My love for technology drives me and I’m excited to learn more and more; I'm really hoping to land a job in the IT field so I can apply what I've learned.<br>
                    I aim to graduate by 2025, after which I want to dive into a master’s degree in cybersecurity to deepen my knowledge and skills.<br>My curiosity and excitement for innovation keep me motivated, and I'm ready to seize any opportunities that come my way in the IT world, especially focused on cybersecurity and software development.                </p>
